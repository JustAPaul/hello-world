Hello World!

I'm learning web development.
I've always wanted to be a coder and now's my chance!

I'm starting with HTML/CSS and Ruby.
I hope to be able to make my own web pages, web apps and programs.
I want to learn Ruby, and Python and code, code, code.

As you can tell from this README I probably should have started with a blog.

Update Jan 9 2017

Installed Atom and attempting a commit and push. Fingers crossed.
??!@$@$ ssh problem using Git Plus package
Jan 10 2017

I think I've got this ssh thing figured out.

Jan 2019 I'm back at it. Haven't really learned the coding stuff. Lots of life being lived.

Now I'd like to learn about databases as well.

Git with GitHub and ssh still a pain. Regenerated keys, added folder in OneDrive as bare master. God. Why make this so frustrating?

So, I needed to change the default integrated terminal from cmd.exe to the long filepath one at %userdir%\AppData\Local\Git\Portable Git.... then set the origin URL (I think is what fixed it) and I was able to sync.

...but only to OneDrive. Makes sense in hindsight. Found a website instructing to CLONE the github.com repository and have that clone reside in the directory on my OneDrive. Now we're talking!

Fingers crossed; I hope this sync works. If not I'll be back.
