Hello World!

I'm learning web development.
I've always wanted to be a coder and now's my chance!

I'm starting with HTML/CSS and Ruby.
I hope to be able to make my own web pages, web apps and programs.
I want to learn Ruby, and Python and code, code, code.

As you can tell from this README I probably should have started with a blog.
